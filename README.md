# <b>Key-Encryption
A three level data encryption program</b>

<p>In this digitalized era, the amount of data created and shared using internet has been increasing day by day. We use different applications for data exchange every day. The number of security threats has also increased due to vulnerabilities in the network and software. Thus, we aim to create a new, personalized data encryption and decryption method that can help its users to exchange data securely.
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding messages in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. We plan to create a program that can encrypt and decrypt data at multiple levels using ASCII values and Binary Tree.

The process takes place at multiple levels, creating different intermediate ciphers, which makes it robust against attacks. Also, no explicit key is used, making the ciphers harder to decrypt. This project can also encrypt/ decrypt text files.

Thus, the data can be easily encrypted and decrypted at a high level simply by using this program.</p>
